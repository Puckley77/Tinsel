        Megan has been planning weddings since 2010. She went to college at Brigham Young University Idaho and studied business and event management. She has planned events all over the country and not only weddings, although those are her favorite! She commonly
        quotes the phrase, “It’s only impossible until it’s done!” She truly has an eye made for the wedding industry and is passionate about helping make your wedding day extra special. She sets the bar and creates new trends. She truly is able to relate
        with so many different styles and clients. We are proud to work as a team under the direction of her artistic creativity. Together, at Tinsel Events, we can accomplish anything.
